                                resolved by a sole mediator who is a neutral third party and will be selected at the
                                mutual acceptance of both parties. Both parties may raise a name for sole mediator and
                                in case both parties accept the proposed name, the said person shall be appointed as
                                sole mediator. In any case the parties are not able to reach a consensus within two
                                proposed mediators, the Company reserves the right to decide who the final mediator is.
                                The decision of the mediator is not binding on both parties, however the parties in good
                                faith will attempt to bind by the decision.

                                Stage 2: Arbitration. In case that mediation does not yield a result suitable or
                                preferred by any one of the parties, arbitration may follow, the award of which is
                                binding on both parties. The Arbitration Board shall comprise three members – one
                                appointed by each party and the third member to be nominated by the two appointed
                                members by mutual consent. Arbitration shall be held at Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The
                                proceedings of arbitration shall be in the English language. The arbitrator’s award
                                shall be final and binding on the Parties. The cost of arbitration will be split equally
                                amongst the parties. If the dispute cannot be resolved by this two-step Alternate
                                Dispute Resolution mechanism, it shall be referred exclusively to the courts at Mumbai,
